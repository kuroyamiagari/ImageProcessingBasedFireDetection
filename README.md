# ImageProcessingBasedFireDetection
This project is made to accurtely detect, classify, alert and extinguish fire in a buiding/room with 24x7 CCTV/Webcam survelliance and no use of sensors.
## Objective
To detect and classify fire flames wrt background using HAAR classifier in python3 and use send the signal to arduino uC for controlling peripherals used for the purpose of alerting and extinguishing the fire.
## Pre-requisites
1. Python3 setup in PC & Cascade GUI trainer installed in your PC (optional, as many readymade cascade gui trained xml files are available on internet)
2. Arduino Uno R3/Uno x1
3. GSM module GSM900/850 x1
4. DC motor pump 12V x1
5. Breadboard x1
6. CCTV/Webcam 13MP (min. recommended)
7. Transistors BC547 x1
8. Resistor 1K x2 + POT 10K x1
9. Relay 5V x1
10. 16x2 LCD display x1
11. Buzzer x1
